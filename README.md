# PhpCsv
A developing csv r/w library which act like a DB ORM

## Introduction
This is a developing project.

If you have a csv file like that
```
id,key,value
# data 1
1,aaa,b
```
We could think this csv as a table of a database. So this project is to manuplate the csv by some ORM function just like you are using the database. We hope that the function name is like the SQL identifier name so that you could learn it without any extra effort.

Now I have finish the reading part and support some sql function.

## Usage
Make sure you have include the library correctly.
